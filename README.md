# Metadata::Ingest::Form

Provides form-backing objects for metadata models

An attempt to provide simpler access to complex back-end data by telling
the form how to group similar fields into a single dual-field entity
("type" and "value" combine to tell the system what the field actually
means).  This only provides a model for doing this - translation is
currently not included.

    gem 'metadata-ingest-form'
